## Hello there, I'm [Mariia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariia-rodina/?locale=en_US)! ![ru3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79466116/148496029-63dd51a7-b961-4744-8bc1-60a6a4f838fd.png)


Iâ€™m a full-stack data scientist at the medical devices manufacture. :syringe: Last two years I use my programming and analytics skills to make our products and the production more efficient, reliable and friendlier for both patients and workers. And I would be interested in applying my skills at more complex challenges. :muscle:


### Skills and tools. :point_down:
* Python 3: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, kats, flask, pytorch, nltk and so on.
* Git, Docker and a bit of MS SQL.
* Machine learning, statistics and some business process analysis.
* Quality management and software validation as a bonus. :sparkles:

Ready to relocate. :tractor:
