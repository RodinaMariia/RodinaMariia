## Hello there, I'm [Mariia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodina-mariia/)! ![ru3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79466116/148496029-63dd51a7-b961-4744-8bc1-60a6a4f838fd.png)


I'm a ML Engineer experienced in different areas. For the past five years, I've been using my programming and analytics skills to make our products and manufacturing more efficient, reliable, and convenient for both patients and workers. And I would be interested in applying my skills to more complex challenges. :muscle:


### Skills and tools. :point_down:
* Python 3: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Kats, Flask, PyTorch, NLTK, Rasa and so on.
* Git, Docker, SQL, AQL.
* Machine learning, statistics, and some business process analysis.
* Quality management and software validation as a bonus. :sparkles:

Ready to relocate. :tractor:
